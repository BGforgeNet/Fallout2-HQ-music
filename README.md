- Unzip into main game directory.
- In `fallout2.cfg` (or `fallout.cfg` for F1), find `[sound]` section and set `music_path1=data\sound\music\`.

Note: HQ music is already included into [Restoration Project](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Restoration_Project), you don't need to install this separately if you use RPU.
